                        <p>Creating a visually pleasing map of where Temple University lies within Tokyo holds significance for prospective students, visitors, and the university community. Such a map provides a clear and engaging representation of the campus's geographical location, helping individuals unfamiliar with the area to navigate and understand its surroundings. Additionally, a visually appealing map enhances the university's online presence and marketing efforts, contributing to a positive perception of the institution and fostering a sense of connection for current and potential stakeholders. A well-designed map not only serves practical purposes but also contributes to the overall aesthetic and branding of Temple University in Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>Making a map on CodePen.io needs a mix of three main skills: HTML sets up the webpage and JavaScript is needed for making things interactive. It's like putting together puzzle pieces to create a map that responds to users. Being good at making things look nice, keeping track of changes with Git, fixing issues, understanding locations on a map, and working well with others are also important for making a map that works and looks good on CodePen.io.</p>
                       
                        <p>  <h2 class="section-heading">Bridging the Gap, Location for New Health Store.</h2>
                        <p>The challenge is to identify a site that meets specific spatial criteria: it should be within a designated empowerment zone, accessible by public transit (within 2000 feet of a subway or regional rail station), and importantly, not in close proximity (within 1200 feet) to existing farmers markets or corner stores participating in the Healthy Corner Store Initiative. The importance of solving this problem lies in promoting equitable access to healthy food options, supporting community development within targeted zones, and strategically avoiding saturation in areas already served by similar initiatives. The goal is to enhance overall community health and well-being by making nutritious food more readily available in carefully selected and accessible locations.</p>

                        <p>Thematic mapping skills will be employed to create choropleth maps, visually representing the geographic distribution of empowerment zones and existing healthy food retailers. A profound understanding of the data and attribute tables is essential for filtering and analyzing potential locations based on specified criteria. Additionally, skills such as spatial join, field calculator, and calculate area and geometry will be instrumental in performing complex spatial analyses, ensuring that the chosen location not only meets the outlined criteria but also contributes to the larger goal of promoting community health and well-being.</p>
                     
                        <p>  <h2 class="section-heading"> Chicago Crime Linked to Airbnbs?</h2>
                        <p>The problem at hand involves examining the potential impact of homicides on tourism in the city of Chicago. The concern is that negative perceptions of safety, often influenced by high crime rates, may deter tourists from visiting the city. To address this, a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of homicide density across police districts in Chicago is required. Furthermore, the comparison of spatial patterns between homicides, Airbnb listings, and Airbnb prices aims to explore the interplay between crime, accommodation options, and pricing, providing insights into how these factors may collectively influence tourism dynamics in the city.</p>

                        <p>Thematic mapping skills will be employed to create choropleth maps, visually representing the spatial distribution of homicide density across police districts. A deep understanding of the data, attribute tables, and the ability to manipulate and analyze data using tools such as calculating features, creating summary tables, and performing spatial joins will be essential. These skills facilitate the comparison of spatial patterns between homicides, Airbnb listings, and Airbnb prices, enabling a comprehensive analysis that informs the broader impact of crime on tourism dynamics in the city.</p>
                      
                        <p>  <h2 class="section-heading">The First of my Mastery; Landfills, Too Close for Comort</h2>
                        <p>The problem of finding schools close to landfills is significant due to potential health and environmental concerns for students and staff. Proximity to landfills may expose schools to air and water pollution, impacting the well-being of individuals within the educational community. Mapping this information is crucial for identifying at-risk schools and implementing mitigation strategies, such as improved waste management practices or relocation of educational institutions to safer zones. Understanding the spatial relationship between schools and landfills helps policymakers, urban planners, and communities make informed decisions to safeguard the health and safety of students and educators.</p>

                        <p>Proficiency in thematic mapping, spatial analysis through tools like spatial join, and a nuanced understanding of data and attribute tables are essential for visualizing and comprehensively analyzing the spatial relationship between schools and landfill sites. The capabilities offered by field calculator and calculating area and geometry are pivotal for precise measurements and assessments. Utilizing these skills enables the development of informed strategies to mitigate potential health and environmental risks associated with schools in close proximity to landfills.</p>
